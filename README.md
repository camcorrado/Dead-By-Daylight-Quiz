# Dead By Daylight Quiz

Test your knowledge of the hit asymmetrical horror game, Dead By Daylight! Can you survive the fog?

## Motivation

This quiz was a great starting point to implement my newly learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & jQuery skills. Originally designed desktop-first as well as consisting of only 10 questions & too much peripheral content, this quiz has been descoped to focus more on quiz functionality, cleaner, more efficient code, & a mobile-first re-design.

Dead By Daylight's play-style functions largely on variability & randomization. I wanted this quiz to reflect this. At the start of the quiz, 10 out of the now 40+ questions are chosen at random & ordered randomly. The order of each question's answers is also randomized each round, discouraging muscle memory from those who have already taken the quiz. The quiz provides user feedback via text & audio while using media queries to create a responsive experience based on whether the user is viewing in portrait or landscape orientation. At the end of the quiz, the user can view their results & retake the quiz. While viewing in the landscape orientation, unique imagery is displayed per question after the user submits their answer & at the end of the quiz, resources to learn more about Dead By Daylight are displayed.
