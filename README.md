# Dead By Daylight Quiz

Gardener allows users to have all the information for their garden in one place: watering frequency, fertilizer frequency, mature height, and more! Users can also see how current and prospective plants will fair within their hardiness zone.

## Motivation

Recently studying HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery, a quiz was a great place to practice what I have learned. With Dead By Daylight as one of my favorite video game, it was an easy choice for content. The quiz provides the user feedback and at the end, resources to learn more about Dead By Daylight.
